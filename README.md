# ColemakDH-ALT-ANSI

I made an alternative version for the Colemak DH Layout on to suit my laptop keyboard so that it is closer to what was advertised on the [ColemakDH site](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/). 
I know that the curl mod gets sacrificed here but this is the best compromise I could come up with for my laptop since some of my keycaps dont match with others.(I like my physical layout to match the software) 

I used the original [ColemakDH for matrix](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/klc) as a basis and then changed it a bit so that the :
* CAPSLOCK was mapped to be BACKSPACE 
* INSERT was mapped to be CAPSLOCK      (Since I have honestly never had to use this key for anything)
* Swapped places of ' and ;     (Just find it easier to use it like this)

In case you want to just change the CAPSLOCK and INSERT like how I did you can follow these [instructions](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/870-hacked-msklc-to-enable-remapping-capslock/)
