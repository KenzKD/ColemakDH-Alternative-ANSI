# ColemakDH-BetterANSI

I made a slightly better version for the Colemak DH Layout on ANSI .

I used the original [ColemakDH for matrix](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/klc) as a basis and then changed it a bit so that the :
* CAPSLOCK BUTTON WAS MAPPED TO BE BACKSPACE 
* INSERT BUTTON WAS MAPPED TO BE CAPSLOCK (Since I have honestly never had to use this key for anything)
