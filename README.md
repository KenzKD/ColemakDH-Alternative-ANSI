# ColemakDH-BetterANSI

I made a slightly better version for the Colemak DH Layout on ANSI so that it is closer to what was advertised on the [ColemakDH site](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) which you can download [here](https://github.com/bobettes1/ColemakDH-BetterANSI/blob/main/colemaka.zip)

I used the original [ColemakDH for matrix](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/klc) as a basis and then changed it a bit so that the :
* CAPSLOCK was mapped to be BACKSPACE 
* INSERT was mapped to be CAPSLOCK      (Since I have honestly never had to use this key for anything)
* Swapped places of ' and ;     (Just find it easier to use it like this)

In case you want to just change the CAPSLOCK and INSERT like how I did you can follow these [instructions](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/870-hacked-msklc-to-enable-remapping-capslock/)
